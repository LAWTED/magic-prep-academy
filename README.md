## Notes
This project was developed as a rapid prototype within a 2-week timeframe through "vibe coding" - prioritizing functionality and innovation. Future iterations will focus on structural refinements and code elegance.

## UI/UX

Just see the product overview for the UI/UX design.



## Auth

Authentication is done via Supabase Auth.


## AI/LLM
- **Model Selection**: GPT-4o-mini for all LLM tasks.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts with config files.
- **Response API**: use [OpenAI Response API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) instead of completion API.
- **Streaming**: use OpenAI Streaming API for some streaming responses, like the chat response.
- **File Search**: use [OpenAI File Search API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) for file search and retrieval.
- **Validator**: JSON validator for output formatting.
   - [] use [OpenAI JSON schema](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs?api-mode=chat#tips-for-your-json-schema) control the output format.


## CI/CD

We use Vercel for CI/CD. Git push to main will deploy to Vercel.



## Assets
- **Avatars**: use Party Animals Characters.
- **Icons**: use Lucide Icons.
- **Other Images**: use OpenAI GPT-4o for image generation.

## Upgrade
Since this is a app built with Vercel and Supabase, we can easily upgrade the app to a production-ready app by upgrading the Vercel and Supabase plan.



## Database

The database is done via Supabase. And we don't do many performance optimizations for the database.
We will do these in the future.

   );
   ```

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Updates**
   - `mentor_student_interactions` table supports real-time chat and notifications
   - Utilizes Supabase's real-time subscription features

2. **Document Versioning**
   - Document version control implemented through `document_versions` table
   - Each version stores complete content for easy rollback
   - Different materials just differ in the `type` and `content` field, domain transferable üëç

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Complex progress data stored using JSONB type
   - Supports flexible progress metric definitions

4. **Gamification**
   - Game mechanics implemented through `user_xp` and `user_hearts`
   - Supports achievement system and rewards mechanism

### Future Optimizations

1. **Partitioning**
   - Consider time-based partitioning for `mentor_student_interactions`
   - Consider user-based partitioning for `documents`

2. **Archiving Strategy**
   - Implement historical data archiving mechanism
   - Set up data retention policies

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add query performance monitoring
   - Implement automated maintenance plans

### Design Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - UUID as primary keys for horizontal scaling
   - JSONB for flexible schema evolution
   - Partitioning strategy for large tables, currently not implemented.

2. **Performance**
   - Strategic indexing for frequent queries, currently not implemented.
   - Efficient data types selection
   - Normalized structure with selective denormalization

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Consistent relationship patterns
   - Well-documented constraints and indexes

4. **Security**
   - Row-level security policies, currently disabled.
   - Role-based access control


## Domain Transferability

### Modular Architecture
- **Component Abstraction**: Domain-agnostic UI components with content injection, like APAPreview and TextPreview, etc.
- **Configuration-Driven Systems**: Prompts are configured for each usability, so that we can easily switch to a new domain.
- **Content Separation**: Psychology is just one subject, we can easily add more subjects, and the core gameplay mechanics can be reused.

6. **Magical Tools Inventory**

   1. Letters of Recommendation (LoR)
      1. Recommender Dashboard: Allow players to input professor/employer details and track letter status (e.g., "Requested," "In Progress," "Submitted")
      2. "Ask a PhD Mentor" Chat: ****Players click "Help" in the LoR tab ‚Üí opens a chat window, then, a PhD mentor can message them and does Q&As; An LLM is linked here, it serves as the PhD mentor and gives human-like, real-time feedback and encouragement to the player
      3. Letter Revision: Interactive templates for emailing recommenders, with auto-fill fields like deadlines, program name
   2. CV/Resume
      1. Upload: Allow players to upload current CV (PDF/DOCX)
      2. Auto-formatting: Auto-restructure CV to field-specific academic templates (in the case of Psychological Science, use the APA format)
      3. Initial evaluation score: Metrics might include Completeness, Academic Jargon Use, Structure, Relevance to Target Program. Example: "Your CV scores 72/100. Boost relevance by adding RA experience!" Use AI to mark red flags: Highlight missing sections (e.g., "Publications," "Conferences")
      4. "Ask a PhD Mentor" Chat
      5. Version Control:
         - Save multiple CV versions (e.g., "PhD Applications," "Master Applications"); Track changes with AI commentary: "Version 3 added 2 publications (+15% completeness)." Export as PDF, LaTeX, or DOCX

7. PhD Mentor Dashboard (A Separate Desktop Version)

   1. Log in: Allow mentors to access data of their paired mentees
   2. Document Review: In a Grammarly-like style, hover over an AI suggestion ‚Üí Click "‚úì" to accept (logged as mentor's edit) or "‚úï" to reject; Example: AI suggests changing "did research" ‚Üí "designed experiments." Mentor clicks "‚úì" ‚Üí Edit is attributed to them
   3. Manual Edit Tools: Mentors type directly into the document ‚Üí Changes are highlighted in blue with their name/avatar
   4. Tag: All edits (AI-accepted or manual) are tagged with the mentor's user name for accountability
   5. Send Back Workflow: Mentor clicks "Send Feedback" ‚Üí Document locks for further edits. Revised document appears in the student's chat with a notification. System auto-generates a summary: "Dr. Jane Smith revised your CV: 12 edits accepted, 3 comments added."
   6. Game Design: Mentors can upload textbooks, blogs, or academic journal articles, and they are automatically "translated" into new mini-game modules, and instantly added to the mentee's game tab (mentioned in 2a). In a Duolingo-like metaphor, this means: Instead of Duolingo already has all the quizes, in this game, you will have a mentor, they assign you new games/tasks everyday based on ever-newer scientific advances, the guru's most recent Tweets, or newly published articles on *Nature* or *Science*.

8. Domain Transfer (IMPORTANT!)

   1. Since this project is not the ACTUAL RESEARCH PROJECT, we want you to pay attention to the codebase's adaptability for future projects. We will evaluate **domain transferability** by analyzing how easily your core function systems (e.g., gamification mechanics, progress tracking, AI-driven content generation) could be repurposed for other games (such as a K12 space physics learning game). To guide your design, we have come up with the following questions for you to THINK HARD before designing the system:
   2. Modularity of systems: Are psychology-specific logic and content decoupled from reusable components (e.g., quiz engines, XP systems)?
   3. Configurability: Can asset pipelines, LLM prompts, and UI templates be swapped via configuration files rather than code rewrites?
   4. Documentation clarity: Do API endpoints and database schemas include domain-agnostic descriptions? Please give an estimate of the additional hours required to adapt the codebase (e.g., 20+ hours for tightly coupled systems vs. <5 hours for modular architectures) and propose optimizations to improve cross-domain reusability for future research.
